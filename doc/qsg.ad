== Requirements

It just doesn't get any easier than this: **Stardog runs on Java 8**. Stardog runs
best on, but does not require, a 64-bit JVM that supports `sun.misc.Unsafe`.

== Insecurity

We optimize Stardog out-of-the-box for ease and simplicity. You should
take additional steps to secure it before production deployment. It's
easy and it's smart, so just do it. In case that's not blunt enough:

NOTE: Stardog ships with an *insecure* but usable default setting: the
super user is `admin` and the `admin` password is "admin". This is
fine until it isn't, at which point you should read the <<Security>>
section.

== Upgrading to Stardog 4

If you are upgrading to Stardog 4 from any previous version, please see
<<Stardog 4>> in <<SNARL Migration Guide>> for details about auto-migrating
pre-4.0 indexes.

== Linux and OSX 

. Tell Stardog where its home directory (where databases and other files will be stored) is
+
[source,bash]
----
$ export STARDOG_HOME=/data/stardog
----
+
If you're using some weird Unix shell that doesn't create environment variables
in this way, adjust accordingly. **If `STARDOG_HOME` isn't defined, Stardog will
use the Java `user.dir` property value.**
+
NOTE: You should consider the <<Upgrading Stardog Server,upgrade process>> when
setting `STARDOG_HOME` for production or other serious usage. In particular, you
probably don't want to set the directory where you install Stardog as
`STARDOG_HOME` as that makes upgrading less easy. Set `STARDOG_HOME` to some
other location.
+
. Copy the `stardog-license-key.bin` into the right place:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cp stardog-license-key.bin $STARDOG_HOME
----
+
Of course `stardog-license-key.bin` has to be readable by the Stardog process.
+
**Stardog won't run without a valid `stardog-license-key.bin` in `STARDOG_HOME`.**
+
. Start the Stardog server. By default the server will expose SNARL and
HTTP interfaces on port 5820.footnote:[That is, the server listens to one port
(5820) and handles both protocols.]
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ./stardog-admin server start
----
+
. Create a database with an input file:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ./stardog-admin db create -n myDB data.ttl
----
+
. Query the database:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ./stardog query myDB "SELECT DISTINCT ?s WHERE { ?s ?p ?o } LIMIT 10"
----
+
You can use the Web Console to search or query the new database you created by
visiting http://localhost:5820/myDB in your browser.

**Now go have a drink: you've earned it.**

== Windows

Windows...really? Okay, but don't blame us if this hurts...The following steps
are carried out using the Windows command prompt which you can find under
menu:Start[Programs > Accessories > Command Prompts] or menu:Start[Run > `cmd`].

First, tell Stardog where its home directory (where databases and other
files will be stored) is:

[source,bash]
----
> set STARDOG_HOME=C:\data\stardog
----

Second, copy the `stardog-license-key.bin` into the right place:

[source,bash]
----
> COPY /B stardog-license-key.bin %STARDOG_HOME%
----

The `/B` is required to perform a binary copy or the license file may get
corrupted. Of course `stardog-license-key.bin` has to be readable by the
Stardog process. Finally, Stardog won't run without a valid `stardog-license-key.bin`
in `STARDOG_HOME`.

Third, start the Stardog server. By default the server will expose SNARL and
HTTP interfaces on port 5820.footnote:[That is, the server listens to one port (5820)
and handles both protocols.]

[source,bash]
----
> stardog-admin.bat server start
----

This will start the server in the current command prompt, you should leave this
window open and open a new command prompt window to continue.

Fourth, create a database with some input file:

[source,bash]
----
> stardog-admin.bat db create -n myDB data.ttl
----

Fifth, query the database:

[source,bash]
----
> stardog.bat query myDB "SELECT DISTINCT ?s WHERE { ?s ?p ?o } LIMIT 10"
----

You can use the Web Console to search or query the new database you created by
hitting http://localhost:5820/myDB in your
browser.

**You should drink the whole bottle, brave Windows user!**
