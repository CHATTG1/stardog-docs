expected performance for queries involving reasoning.
*FIX: Bug in reasoning query evaluation where the property variable is
unbound which resulted in incorrect inferences to be returned.

ignored.
*MOD: Offlining a database will drop the database completely out of
memory reducing server overhead of having large, offline databases.
*MOD: Increased packet size in SNARL protocol changing maximum size
from 64k to 16.7M bytes.  This raises the maximum size of a triple or query
that can be exchanged to the protocol to nearly 17MB and should avoid any
issues with loading datasets with large literals.  Earlier versions of
the SNARL protocol from 0.9.5 and earlier are not compatible with the new
format.

better reflect total execution time.
*FIX: Resolved issue in query generation arising from a variable being
used in a BGP, context statement, and within an optional causing no results

== 0.6.10 Release
[none]
*FIX: Fixed an issue with not always consuming the HTTP response which
could lead to not releasing HTTP connections to the pool and it its eventual
exhaustion.
*MOD: Improved algebraic rewriting of query plans which avoid multiple
evaluation of the same part of the query, e.g., the operator in both parts
of a UNION.
*MOD: A better handling of the UNION operator by sorting its output
which facilitates joins with other operators in the query plan.
*MOD: A better handling of deep chains of nested joins by maintaining
a certain order of intermediate results produced by hash joins and avoiding
page loads.
*MOD: An improved, threadsafe implementation of the query plan cache,
which is now concurrently accessible from all connections. This allows

automatically start with other system services at the boot time.

== 0.6.9 Release
[none]
*FIX: Fixed an issue pertaining to QL rewrites with optionals that use a
filter which was causing incorrect results for some QL queries (ticket #44).
*FIX: Fixed query evaluation where the presence of a particular
combintation of union, optional, and distinct can lead to nondistinct result
sets (ticket #48).
*FIX: Fixed the passing of the disableSecurity flag into the HTTP server
*FIX: Fixed a bug in the rendering of SPARQL queries using isBlank with
remote endpoints
*FIX: Fixed a bug in query evaluation arising from a certain combination
of order by, limit, and optional where the sort key is on a variable bound
by an optional pattern.
*FIX: User specified query bindings specified via Query.parameter are
correctly serialized and sent to the remote server.
*MOD: Query rewriting now fails when a query has BGP's that are not
supported by the reasoner; this is strict mode.  Strict mode can be disabled
and the reasoner will rewrite only the BGP's it supports.  This introduces a
JVM flag 'strictReasoning' for controlling this behavior.
*MOD: HTTP connection will now switch over to HTTP POST if the SPARQL
query is very long to avoid any potential URL overflow issues.
*ADD: CLI now includes an 'export' function to dump the contents of part
or all of a Stardog database to RDF.

binding is at the beginning or end of an iteration. (ticket #34)
*FIX: Resolved synchronization issue for connections to an index that are
fetched from the internal connection pool.  Resolves getting already closed
connections from the pool. (ticket #37)
*FIX: Datatyped literals used in filters were getting munged during QL
rewrites resulting in an exception. (ticket #35)
*MOD: Iteration over disk indices modified to more efficiently
calcuate which pages are actually required to answer the query and avoid
loading intermediate pages.

== 0.6 Release
[none]

*FIX: Bug pertaining to loading datasets which use literals larger than
8k.
*FIX: Bug in the writer locks that could allow multiple writers access to
an index in a multithreaded environment, which usually lead to corruptted
indexes (ticket #29).
*FIX: Issue with the CLI's database create command, multiple calls in
rapid succession to create databases caused some of the new databases to be
lost (ticket #32).
*FIX: QL query rewriter was mangling the variables used within the query
in certain situations causing query results to be incorrect (ticket #30).
*FIX: QL query rewriter was not correctly respecting variable
substitutions with datatyped literals and was subsequently losing the
variable binding specified by the user (ticket #31).
*FIX: FROM/FROM Named clauses were incorrectly set to the HTTP server
*MOD: Improved index page load speed.
*MOD: Reduced memory requirements in the indexes wrt to cache overhead
*MOD: Persistence of memory indexes to disk is now done in parallel to
the greatest extent possible yield a significant increase in save (and load)
performance.  This required changing the on disk format of memory indexes.
Old versions of memory indexes are unfortunately, backwards incompatible
with these updates.  We apologize for the inconvenience.
*MOD: On format of disk-based indexes.  This helps us resolve some
issues we had with the previous format, and increases load speed, but the
index format is backwards incompatible with the previous indexes.  However,
we provide a migration utility in the command line program for changing
old disk indexes to the new format.  See the CLI for more information on
migrating old indexes (or ping the mailing list).
*MOD: Decreased memory usage in the query engine
*MOD: Added a change buffer in the layer between the SNARL API and
the underlying index it is connected to.  This allows most changes within a
transaction to be pushed into the index at once increasing the performance
of commits as the changes can mostly be applied in bulk.

== 0.5.3 Release
[none]

*ADD: Internal buffer for changes via the Sesame API, triples are no
longer added to the Stardog database one at a time via the SAIL API.  They
are buffered until the buffer is full, a read operation occurs, or the
transaction is committed.
*FIX: Internal bookkeeping for the state of the system information,
timestamp for last update time is correctly updated and you should not get
the out of sync warnings printed to the console.
*FIX: Incorrect return code for parse errors in HTTP protocol.
*FIX: NPE thrown by TBox extractor when encountering non object/data
properties.
*FIX: Correct behavior for SPARQL queries w/ QL reasoning that uses the
'GRAPH' keyword.  BGP's in graph contexts are not rewritten as inferences
are put into the default, no context, graph.  Hybrid queries that include
some patterns against the default graph and others against patterns in graph
contexts are correctly partially rewritten. (ticket #27)

== 0.5.2 Release
[none]

*MOD: Add, Remove and Clear Contexts now take an optional query
parameter, "graph-uri" which specfies the named graph the operation should
be executed against.  This deprecates the use of this parameter *in* the
actual URL.  See HTTP_PROTOCOL.txt for additional details.
*MOD: Temp files used to track changes during transactions and to
buffer results coming into HTTP server are more aggresively removed.
*FIX: Specifying 'null' as the context to remove via the Connection API
now actually deletes the default context rather than the entire contents of
the database.
*FIX: Cast exception caused during QL query execution when the usage of
the property in the query does not match the type (object v data) of the
property in the kb. (ticket #24)
*FIX: NPE during evaluation of a query with QL reasoning enabled when the
query has a optionals nested inside of a graph statement. (ticket #26)
*FIX: Could get NPE's during filter evaluation (compare expressions only)
if one of the variables in the expression was not bound to any value in a
BGP.
*FIX: Malformed literals in inserts could come back and cause errors when
being removed.  Errors are now thrown when a malformed literal (invalid
language tag or inconsistent xsd datatype) is inserted into the database.
(ticket #22 & #25)
*FIX: Resolving BGP's across contexts using wildcards (e.g. graph ?g {
... }) was losing information between the contexts leading to incorrect
results and/or null values in the results. (ticket #20 & #21)
*ADD: Gremlin integration via our Sesame Sail implementation and the
Blueprints API.  See the README for more details on the integration.
*ADD: statements(subject, predicate, object, context) to the Remover API
and deprecated statement(...); the latter only accepted non-null values,
while the former does accept nulls as wildcards, so it is safe to replace
all usages of one with the other. statement(...) is marked as deprecated and
schedule for removal from the API no earler than 0.6.

== 0.5.1 Release
[none]

*FIX: Deleting statements with wildcards via a StardogRepository.

[none]

*FIX: Bug in the concurrent calcuation of statistics where a latch could
get stuck when certain types of exceptions occured during processing
*FIX: Issue in Remove CLI where description did not match behavior;
Specifying only a context now deletes the context as stated in the
documentation. (ticket #17)
*FIX: Bug in removing a context within a durable transaction that caused
the transaction record to get corrupted. (ticket #16)
*MOD: Changed Add CLI to print an error message if no files are
specified to add to the database.
*MOD: Removed default parse format of RDF/XML from add & remove
operations.  If a specific format is specified, that is used, otherwise the
format based on the file extension will be used.  This brings the behavior
of add & remove inline with create.  RDF/XML is still used as the fallback
when no format is specified and there is a nonstandard extension on the
file.
*MOD: Modified how some filters are evaluated greatly increasing the
speed in which basic (and/or/not & compares) filters are executed.

== 0.4.9 Release
[none]

*ADD: Handling of the TOP concept in the OWL 2 QL reasoner

the HTTP server.
*FIX: Mangling of ASK queries when sending them to the HTTP server.
(ticket #13)
*FIX: Typo in help information in the add/remove data commands in the
CLI.

memory, it will not be overwritten on shutdown. (ticket #11)
*FIX: UnsupportedOperationException thrown when clearing a context within
a transaction. (ticket #12)
*FIX: IllegalArgumentException thrown when literals are used in query
atoms going through rewriting. (ticket #9)
*FIX: ClassCastException when non-QL axioms are used. (ticket #8)
*FIX: Issue with deleting directories when STARDOG_HOME contains relative
paths. (ticket #6)
*FIX: NullPointerException when top level scope contains an empty set of
query atoms. (ticket #7)
*FIX: Closing temporary files in the data directory used for some file
operations.
*FIX: Concurrent modification exception from an iterator when persisting
memory indexes to disk asynchronously.
*FIX: HTTP protocol was dropping context information from queries.
*MOD: Queueing of jobs during concurrent loading to avoid running out
of memory when processing large datasets. This also reduces the amount of
memory used during loading.
*MOD: Altered algorithm to get better estimates of join cardinalities.
*MOD: Memory databases to use new statistics algorithm.

== 0.4.8 Release
[none]

*ADD: Creation of db indices is done in parallel. It is an experimental
feature which can be disabled via the JVM flag (disableConcurrent); note,
that concurrent loading requires more RAM than serial loading. Either give
Stardog more RAM (i.e., as much as you cann spare) on startup or pass the
disableConcurrent flag.
*FIX: Query atoms of the form { ?a ?a ?b } now return correct results
*FIX: Bug in multi-key joins
*FIX: Bug in QL reasoning optimizer for detecting empty joins
*FIX: File exhaustion bug.  When Sesame integration was used with the
HTTP server, the server did not always close the temporary files used to
track the incoming edits causing some systems to report too many files were
open.
*FIX: Bug in query evaluation where the named graph bound in a pattern
could cause an exception during execution.
*FIX: Cardinality estimates in index statistics
*FIX: bug in stardog.sh script so that it can run anywhere (thanks Alin Dreghiciu for this fix)
*MOD: The name of the file being added/removed from a database in the command line is now printed.

== 0.4.7 Release
[none]

*FIX: Fixed an NPE in the HTTP server (reported by Brian Sletten)
*MOD: make the QL axioms parser more strictly respect the OWL spec, especially w/r/t to the set of datatypes that QL supports
