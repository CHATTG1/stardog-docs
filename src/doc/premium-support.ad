Customers of Stardog's Enterprise Premium Support have access to the following
capabilities and services. Enterprise Premium Support is available as of Stardog
3 release. mailto:sales@complexible.com[Email] for details.

== Real-time Support

Get access to the core Stardog development team in real-time via voice
or chat. Let us help you get the most from Stardog, 24/7. Our core
team has more semantic graph application and tool development
experience than any other team on the planet. Other vendors shunt you
off to inexperienced level one techs. We've never done that and never will.

== Private Maven Repositories

See <<Using Maven>> for details; this includes a per-customer, private
Maven repository, CDN-powered, for 24/7 builds, updates, and feature
releases.

We're also tying Maven and Docker together, providing private Docker
repositories for customers, which allows us to build out clusters,
custom configurations, best practices, and devops tips-and-tricks into
custom Docker images...so that you don't have to.

== Private Docker Repositories

Docker-based deliverables not only shortens your development and
devops cycles but keeps you up-to-date with the latest-greatest
versions of Stardog, including security fixes, performance hot fixes,
and deployment best practices and configurations.

== Priority Bug Fixes 

With Maven and Docker in place, we've got a software delivery
mechanism ready to push priority bug fixes into your enterprise as
soon as they're ready. We've averaged one Stardog release every two
weeks since 2012. Enterprise Premium Support customers can
now take advantage of our development pace in a controlled fashion.

== Priority Feature Releases

We hate holding new features in a feature branch, especially for
mundane business reasons; we want to release new stuff as soon as
possible to our customers. With Enterprise Premium Support, we can
maintain a disruptive pace of innovation without disrupting *you*.
