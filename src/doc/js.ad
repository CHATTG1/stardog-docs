== stardog.js

This framework wraps all the functionality of a client for the Stardog DBMS and
provides access to a full set of functions such as executing SPARQL Queries,
administration tasks on Stardog, and the use of the Reasoning API.

The implementation uses the HTTP protocol, since most of Stardog
functionality is available using this protocol. For more information, see
<<Network Programming>>.

The framework is currently supported for node.js and the browser, including test
cases for both environments. You'll also need npm and bower to run the test
cases and install the dependencies in node.js & the browser respectively.
