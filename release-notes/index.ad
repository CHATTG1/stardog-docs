image:a.png[] Added new feature &nbsp; &nbsp; image:m.png[] Modified system
&nbsp; &nbsp; image:f.png[] Fixed bug &nbsp; &nbsp; image:s.png[] Security vulernability

== 4.2.4 Release
[none]
* image:s.png[Security,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; Fixed privilege escalation in HA Cluster; *affected version*: Stardog 4.2.3
 (*SD-SEC-HA1*)

WARNING: As discovered by Martin Hostettler and Fabian Cretton, Stardog cluster
has a privilege escalation vulnerability fixed in 4.2.4. User and role
permissions propagate correctly, but whenever any user attempted to run any
command on the cluster with valid credentials, they were auth'd as a superuser.
So given any valid credentials, once auth'd you could do anything. Single
servers are not affected by vulnerability.

correctly serialized and sent to the remote server.
* image:m.png[Fixed,15,16]&nbsp;&nbsp; Query rewriting now fails when a query has BGP's that are not
supported by the reasoner; this is strict mode.  Strict mode can be disabled
and the reasoner will rewrite only the BGP's it supports.  This introduces a
JVM flag 'strictReasoning' for controlling this behavior.

indexes (ticket #29).
* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; Issue with the CLI's database create command, multiple calls in
rapid succession to create databases caused some of the new databases to be
lost (ticket #32).

* image:m.png[Fixed,15,16]&nbsp;&nbsp; Persistence of memory indexes to disk is now done in parallel to
the greatest extent possible yield a significant increase in save (and load)
performance.  This required changing the on disk format of memory indexes.
Old versions of memory indexes are unfortunately, backwards incompatible
with these updates.  We apologize for the inconvenience.
* image:m.png[Fixed,15,16]&nbsp;&nbsp; On format of disk-based indexes.  This helps us resolve some
issues we had with the previous format, and increases load speed, but the
index format is backwards incompatible with the previous indexes.  However,
we provide a migration utility in the command line program for changing
old disk indexes to the new format.  See the CLI for more information on
migrating old indexes (or ping the mailing list).
* image:m.png[Fixed,15,16]&nbsp;&nbsp; Decreased memory usage in the query engine
* image:m.png[Fixed,15,16]&nbsp;&nbsp; Added a change buffer in the layer between the SNARL API and

'GRAPH' keyword.  BGP's in graph contexts are not rewritten as inferences
are put into the default, no context, graph.  Hybrid queries that include
some patterns against the default graph and others against patterns in graph
contexts are correctly partially rewritten. (ticket #27)

== 0.5.2 Release
[none]

* image:m.png[Fixed,15,16]&nbsp;&nbsp; Add, Remove and Clear Contexts now take an optional query
parameter, "graph-uri" which specfies the named graph the operation should
be executed against.  This deprecates the use of this parameter *in* the
actual URL.  See HTTP_PROTOCOL.txt for additional details.
* image:m.png[Fixed,15,16]&nbsp;&nbsp; Temp files used to track changes during transactions and to
buffer results coming into HTTP server are more aggresively removed.

now actually deletes the default context rather than the entire contents of
the database.

the property in the query does not match the type (object v data) of the
property in the kb. (ticket #24)
* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; NPE during evaluation of a query with QL reasoning enabled when the
query has a optionals nested inside of a graph statement. (ticket #26)
* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; Could get NPE's during filter evaluation (compare expressions only)
if one of the variables in the expression was not bound to any value in a
BGP.
* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; Malformed literals in inserts could come back and cause errors when
being removed.  Errors are now thrown when a malformed literal (invalid
language tag or inconsistent xsd datatype) is inserted into the database.
(ticket #22 & #25)
* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; Resolving BGP's across contexts using wildcards (e.g. graph ?g {
... }) was losing information between the contexts leading to incorrect
results and/or null values in the results. (ticket #20 & #21)
* image:a.png[Fixed,15,14]&nbsp;&nbsp; Gremlin integration via our Sesame Sail implementation and the
Blueprints API.  See the README for more details on the integration.
* image:a.png[Fixed,15,14]&nbsp;&nbsp; statements(subject, predicate, object, context) to the Remover API
and deprecated statement(...); the latter only accepted non-null values,
while the former does accept nulls as wildcards, so it is safe to replace
all usages of one with the other. statement(...) is marked as deprecated and
schedule for removal from the API no earler than 0.6.

== 0.5.1 Release
[none]

* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; Deleting statements with wildcards via a StardogRepository.
* image:a.png[Fixed,15,14]&nbsp;&nbsp; Support for the Sesame RepositoryFactory & Config APIs so Stardog
can be used via the OpenRDF shell and Workbench.
* image:a.png[Fixed,15,14]&nbsp;&nbsp; Native connection pools for Stardog connections.  See the examples
for code demonstrating how to configure and use them.

== 0.5 Release
[none]

* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; Query objects reference to database was not refeshed after commit
or rollback of transaction. (ticket #15)
* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug in queries with graph contexts using unbound variables via an
HTTP connection; the variable was getting mangled.
* image:m.png[Fixed,15,16]&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduced new Flex Indexes into the Database structure.
* image:a.png[Fixed,15,14]&nbsp;&nbsp; Shiro based security layer

== 0.4.10 Release
[none]

* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug in the concurrent calcuation of statistics where a latch could
get stuck when certain types of exceptions occured during processing
* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; Issue in Remove CLI where description did not match behavior;
Specifying only a context now deletes the context as stated in the
documentation. (ticket #17)
* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug in removing a context within a durable transaction that caused
the transaction record to get corrupted. (ticket #16)
* image:m.png[Fixed,15,16]&nbsp;&nbsp; Changed Add CLI to print an error message if no files are
specified to add to the database.
* image:m.png[Fixed,15,16]&nbsp;&nbsp; Removed default parse format of RDF/XML from add & remove
operations.  If a specific format is specified, that is used, otherwise the
format based on the file extension will be used.  This brings the behavior
of add & remove inline with create.  RDF/XML is still used as the fallback
when no format is specified and there is a nonstandard extension on the
file.
* image:m.png[Fixed,15,16]&nbsp;&nbsp; Modified how some filters are evaluated greatly increasing the
speed in which basic (and/or/not & compares) filters are executed.

== 0.4.9 Release
[none]

* image:a.png[Fixed,15,14]&nbsp;&nbsp; Handling of the TOP concept in the OWL 2 QL reasoner
* image:a.png[Fixed,15,14]&nbsp;&nbsp; New query operator which provides more efficient evaluation of
queries where order by and limit are used.
* image:a.png[Fixed,15,14]&nbsp;&nbsp; System information regarding which databases are present will be
reloaded from disk when it is changed by an external source.
* image:a.png[Fixed,15,14]&nbsp;&nbsp; JVM flag to disable strict mode of parsing.
* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; Encoding of graph URIs in remove context calls to HTTP server.
* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; Typo in route which effectively hid the remove context endpoint in
the HTTP server.
* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; Mangling of ASK queries when sending them to the HTTP server.
(ticket #13)
* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; Typo in help information in the add/remove data commands in the
CLI.
* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; BOM markers at the start of files will be gracefully handled
instead of failing to parse.
* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; If copy of system info on disk is more recent than cached copy in
memory, it will not be overwritten on shutdown. (ticket #11)
* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; UnsupportedOperationException thrown when clearing a context within
a transaction. (ticket #12)
* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; IllegalArgumentException thrown when literals are used in query
atoms going through rewriting. (ticket #9)
* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; ClassCastException when non-QL axioms are used. (ticket #8)
* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; Issue with deleting directories when STARDOG_HOME contains relative
paths. (ticket #6)
* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; NullPointerException when top level scope contains an empty set of
query atoms. (ticket #7)
* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; Closing temporary files in the data directory used for some file
operations.
* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; Concurrent modification exception from an iterator when persisting
memory indexes to disk asynchronously.
* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; HTTP protocol was dropping context information from queries.
* image:m.png[Fixed,15,16]&nbsp;&nbsp; Queueing of jobs during concurrent loading to avoid running out
of memory when processing large datasets. This also reduces the amount of
memory used during loading.
* image:m.png[Fixed,15,16]&nbsp;&nbsp; Altered algorithm to get better estimates of join cardinalities.
* image:m.png[Fixed,15,16]&nbsp;&nbsp; Memory databases to use new statistics algorithm.

== 0.4.8 Release
[none]

* image:a.png[Fixed,15,14]&nbsp;&nbsp; Creation of db indices is done in parallel. It is an experimental
feature which can be disabled via the JVM flag (disableConcurrent); note,
that concurrent loading requires more RAM than serial loading. Either give
Stardog more RAM (i.e., as much as you cann spare) on startup or pass the
disableConcurrent flag.
* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; Query atoms of the form { ?a ?a ?b } now return correct results
* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug in multi-key joins
* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug in QL reasoning optimizer for detecting empty joins
* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; File exhaustion bug.  When Sesame integration was used with the
HTTP server, the server did not always close the temporary files used to
track the incoming edits causing some systems to report too many files were
open.
* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; Bug in query evaluation where the named graph bound in a pattern
could cause an exception during execution.
* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; Cardinality estimates in index statistics
* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; bug in stardog.sh script so that it can run anywhere (thanks Alin Dreghiciu for this fix)
* image:m.png[Fixed,15,16]&nbsp;&nbsp; The name of the file being added/removed from a database in the command line is now printed.

== 0.4.7 Release
[none]

* image:f.png[Fixed,15,15]&nbsp;&nbsp; Fixed an NPE in the HTTP server (reported by Brian Sletten)
* image:m.png[Fixed,15,16]&nbsp;&nbsp; make the QL axioms parser more strictly respect the OWL spec, especially w/r/t to the set of datatypes that QL supports
