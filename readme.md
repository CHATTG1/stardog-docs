We write Stardog docs in Asciidoc. We build with a combination of
Grunt and some Ruby stuffs.

## Development Setup

No longer do you need to set up a local environment. Just check out the docker image via the directions [here](https://github.com/stardog-union/stardog/wiki/Deploying-documentation)

## Editing Docs

* edit *.ad files using asciidoctor syntax. Note: Asciidoctor != Markdown...!
* edit Sass in style if you need to tweak CSS (you probably don't)
* build, publish, and release through the [docker image](https://github.com/stardog-union/stardog/wiki/Deploying-documentation)
